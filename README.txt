Custom Armor Test Mod with IArmorTextureProvider
Minecraft 1.4.7
Minecraft Forge 6.6.0.497

This is the source code for a Custom Armor Test Mod to be used with Forge.
Please import customarmortestiatp-master's contents (where this README.txt is)
to \forge\mcp\src\minecraft\mod\customarmortestiatp using Eclipse.

This achieves custom armor rendering, this time with implementing IArmorTextureProvider. No changes in \forge\mcp\jars\bin\minecraft.jar are necessary for this mod to work. Compare and contrast with my other repository at https://github.com/Seigyoku/customarmortest to see how the different approaches work.

The Mod is not written for MultiPlayer, so there is no supplied server-side coding.
